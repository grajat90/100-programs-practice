# 100-programs-practice
---

This is a personal project/challenge where I will code 100 programs of varying hardness levels to become more fluent in solving problems programatically. It is sort of a modification of 100 days of code challenge but due to my schedule, I don't get time to code everyday. However, I will try my best to be as regular as possible.

## These are the programs till now:

1. Ducci Sequence - [Reddit DailyProgrammer thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/8sjcl0/20180620_challenge_364_intermediate_the_ducci/) - Python 2.7
